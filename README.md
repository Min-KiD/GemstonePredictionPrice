This is our project in machine learning subject in HUST uni

About the project: we focus on predicting the price of gemstones based on some attributes 

Learn more about the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data, `train.csv` is used for training, and `test.csv` is used for prediction and then submitted to kaggle for final result

- Open and read the file `ML-Project-Report(Gemstone).pdf` which is a brief report of our work 
- Open and read the file `GemstoneProject.ipynb` for detail of our work
- Open and read the file `Experiment.ipynb` for testing the hyper-parameter in the model or preprocessing part, trying the ideal we have with datasets, and see if you can do better, the coding for Optuna is at the bottom. You can also try to make your parameter or take the parameter we have tuned to put in there for the submission
