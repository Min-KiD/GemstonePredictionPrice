This is our project in machine learning subject in HUST uni

About the project: we focus on predicting the price of gemstones based on some attributes 

Learn more about the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data, `train.csv` is used for training, and `test.csv` is used for prediction then submitted to kaggle for final result

- Open and read the file `GemstoneProject.ipynb` for detail of our work, we also have the introduction in there, and the result at the bottom
- Open and read the file `Experiment.ipynb` for testing the hyper-parameter in the model, trying the ideal we have with datasets, and see if you can do better, the coding for Optuna is at the bottom. You can also try to make your parameter or take the parameter we have tuned to put in there for the submission.
