Learn more about the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data, `train.csv` is used for training, and `test.csv` is used for prediction then submitted to kaggle for final result

- Open and read the file `GemstoneProject.ipynb` for detail of our work, we also have the introduction in there, and the result at the bottom
- Open and read the file `Experiment.ipynb` for testing the hyper-parameter in the model, trying the ideal we have with datasets, and see if you can do better, the coding for Optuna is at the bottom
